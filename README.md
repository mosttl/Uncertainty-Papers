# Uncertainty Papers 
ðŸ”¥ As large language models (LLMs) are inherently probabilistic, uncertainty is a critical factor in their real-world applications. Key research directions include quantifying and assessing uncertainty, strategies for reducing it, and methods for effectively managing it. This repository curates an up-to-date collection of research papers focused on the latest advancements in uncertainty within LLMs and Agents, as well as in deep learning more broadly.
